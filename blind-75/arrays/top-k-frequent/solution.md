### Intuition 
- For bucket sort 
- first count all the occurences for different Numbers 
- each array index is an array to store how many elements have that particular count
- for example if two numbers have count 3 then both of them will be stored in index 3 of the array
- using the count as the index of an array store the numbers 
- iterate through the last for k items.
