##### Intuition
- Complement equals target - current
- create a dict and keep adding the current number and the index in the dict
- calculate the complement for each number and check if it is present in the dict
- return indexes when condition meets.

- **Important** -> to get index + nums at the same time use enumerate.

- Time and Space Complexity -> O(n) & O(n)
- The insertion and lookup time of a hashmap is O(1).
